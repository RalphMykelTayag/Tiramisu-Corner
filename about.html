      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Every great dessert has a story, and so does The Tiramisu Corner.
         It all started with a simple love for homemade sweets and a family tradition of sharing desserts at the table.
         Our founder grew up watching loved ones prepare tiramisu for gatherings layer by layer, with care and affection. Over time, that family recipe became more than just a dessert; it became a symbol of warmth, comfort, and togetherness.
         With a dream of sharing that same feeling with the community, The Tiramisu Corner was born. What began in a small kitchen, experimenting with classic and modern flavors, has now grown into a cozy corner where everyone is welcome.
         Here, we don’t just serve desserts we serve memories. Every slice of tiramisu is prepared with the same passion and dedication that started it all, using only the freshest ingredients to ensure each bite feels like home.
         Our mission is simple: to spread joy, comfort, and sweetness one dessert at a time. Whether you’re celebrating a milestone, catching up with friends, or treating yourself after a long day, we’re here to make your moments special.
         At The Tiramisu Corner, every bite tells a story. We invite you to be part of ours. ❤️</p>
